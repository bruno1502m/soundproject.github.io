## Website Creation and Personal Touch
As we searched for ideas for our project, the boxes we stumbled upon at NYUAD, labeled “Campus Tour" for the incoming class of 2027, caught our attention. It was a bittersweet sight, as it reminded us of the campus tour we missed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we realized that not everyone had the opportunity to visit the campus, especially those who were unable to travel to the United Arab Emirates.
This realization sparked a sense of empathy towards those sitting at home, longing for the campus experience. We were inspired to develop a creative solution that could bring the campus to them. That's when the idea of creating soundscapes for the most cherished areas of our campus struck us.

We envisioned using a narrator to introduce the significance of each location on campus, providing a virtual tour experience for new students who could not physically visit. By incorporating immersive soundscapes, we could transport users to these locations, allowing them to absorb the atmosphere and feel as though they were present on campus. The sounds of bustling student activity in the Baraha, the high-energy atmosphere in the Performance Gym, and the echoes of laughter at the Palms - all of these elements would be carefully curated to create an auditory experience that would make users feel connected to the campus, no matter where they were.

Our goal was to ensure that new students at home could feel a sense of belonging and familiarity with the campus, despite the physical distance. In addition, we hoped that by providing an engaging and interactive virtual tour, we could ease their longing and create a sense of community even in a remote setting.

## Audio Process
Once the theme of our project was decided, we realized that time was of the essence, and we needed to start immediately. We began by dividing roles among the team to increase our efficiency and make the most of the limited time we had. We outlined the steps we needed to take to ensure the success of our project.

Booking the necessary equipment was a top priority to avoid any delays. We also needed to write a script that struck the right balance between being descriptive enough for users to understand, but also concise enough to fit within the allocated time for each soundscape. This turned out to be more challenging than we had anticipated, as we had to carefully choose the language and refine the script to perfection. However, after investing considerable time and effort, we were satisfied with the final product.
To challenge ourselves further, we decided to use professional equipment that we had been trained to use, aiming for a high originality rate of 98%+ in our audio recordings. This meant that we could only use 2% of audio from the internet, and we spent three days recording all the soundscape audio. It was a fun but exhausting process, as we had to re-record multiple times to avoid any distortions or unwanted background noise. We even had to walk slowly to prevent wind interference with our sensitive microphones.

Once we had all the audio clips, we used "Audacity" for editing. We applied functions like normalization of loudness, cropping, fade-in, fade-out, and noise reduction to merge the clips seamlessly and achieve the desired smoothness in the final version. It was a meticulous process that required attention to detail and technical expertise, but we were determined to make it perfect.

Despite the challenges and hard work, we were proud of our team's dedication and commitment to creating a high-quality product. We had learned valuable lessons in project management, audio recording, and editing, and we were excited to see our idea come to life as we moved towards the final stages of our project.

## Monologue and Soundscape Format
Going with a monologue format and then a soundscape was what we thought would best depict our message. We wanted the website's viewers to know what people get up to in the area, then immerse themselves in the auditory experience of the soundscapes. The monologue ends with the same last sentence for the sake of continuity and to tie them all together.

## Performance Gym Soundscape

To do the performance gym soundscape, we had to take permission from the practicing team. We recorded their chants and communication, but as to not get in the way of the game, we did not record the ball audio. Instead, we took a basketball and independently created these sounds along with the shoes skidding on the basketball floor. Overall, finding this audio and adding in elements was a lengthy process as we couldn’t get it quite right. The specific issue faced with basketball was that it did not feel authentic enough. To combat this, we went back the next day and filmed the shoe skidding, as when you’re playing, it's the main thing you hear.

## Arts Center Soundscape
For the arts center, creating a typical soundscape didn’t seem quite right. This is because the arts center is always quiet, yet hidden within the walls of each room are highly talented individuals. This is why we decided to take this chance to highlight some personal favorite NYUAD student art produced in the art center. We choose Jiire since he frequently performs at university events, and almost everyone is aware of him, and the same goes for Yerk. We cut out snippets of our favorite songs from both these artists and included a picture so you can see the men behind the beautiful work. Getting permission to use their art and image was not a complex process; however, it took time because they wanted to approve and ensure our usage was appropriate.

## Consent and Permissions
Getting permission/consent from people is something we have to do very often throughout. We could not go unnoticed as we recorded almost everything in the audio using high-quality professional equipment from the equipment center. So naturally, people questioned what we were doing, and we asked them if we could film what they were getting up to. Many said yes, and few said no. It was easy for them to say yes because all the voices that could be tied back to identity were from people in our group. This is because everything recorded (voice) was done by someone in the group, and we only used sounds of people carrying out their normal activity for the soundscape.



## Website and Interactivity
We created a simple yet interactive website to host the campus soundscape. The website has a header, a banner with the name of the website and the description and a campus map that has pinpoints you can interact with by clicking on them. Also there is an active textbox that updates with the user’s interaction on the page. We included music by some arts students after asking for their permission. 

The JavaScript code sets up a canvas and displays an image of a campus map with several pinpoints on it. When a pinpoint is clicked, an interface is displayed with information about the corresponding location on campus, an image of the place and the soundscape is played. The user can stop the sound from playing by pressing the exit button next to any interface. 

There are two tabs for the interaction: the “Tour” tab and the “Explore” tab. The tour tab takes the user on a guided tour by carefully selecting which location on campus we want the user to visit next and hiding the other locations. The explore tab shows all the locations at once and the user is free to select any of the tabs. You can easily switch between explore and tour by clicking on the tabs. 

The code also includes a fireworks animation by Daniel Shiffman at the end of the guided tour to celebrate the user’s completion of the tour. The active textbox has comments about the location and also encourages the user to continue with the tour. 

To make the website like an official NYUAD page we used images from the NYUAD website and the text font is set to ‘Gotham’, the university official online text font. We also used colors that represent the school to create the interface. The pictures that were used in the website were also taken from NYUAD’s official website. We added pictures instead of videos because we wanted the user to solely focus on the auditory environment of each location.

## Reflections and Future Improvements:
We also took the initiative to compile a list of [reviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bPRtxwp3VK_PSeeKVAG58Y80_ADZgm4M4rcxCj_Lpaw/edit?usp=sharing) from students on campus, sharing their favorite spots and the reasons behind their choices. Our vision was to incorporate these reviews as smaller landmarks or pins on the map, so that incoming students who couldn't be physically present on campus could still gain an understanding of the student perspective. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to add these pins to the website for this project. Nevertheless, we plan to include them in future updates.

Additionally, we faced challenges in obtaining permissions from creators to collect audios from NYUAD Arts Center students, resulting in only two audio recordings being included in our project. Moving forward, we aim to collect a greater number of student audios in order to properly showcase the talent that NYUAD has to offer.

Furthermore, the combined time allocated for the soundscapes was limited to approximately four minutes, which meant that we had to prioritize certain areas over others. Although we recorded additional areas, such as the convenience store, we were unable to incorporate them into the website. In the future, we aspire to cover all the important places on campus, including D1, the Library, and the Convenience Store, to provide a comprehensive experience for users exploring the campus through our soundscapes.

A feature we could have changed was the use of formal images. Since our website is for students by students the formal images give it a more formal look. Granted, we did this in hopes that if one day this was properly funded and delved into maybe this could be turned into something formal that the university can send out to people that for any reason will miss the actual tour.  The font and color choice was consistent with university official documents the purple, grey and black paired with the Gotham font.
